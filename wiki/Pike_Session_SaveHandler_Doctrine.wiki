= What can I do with Pike_Session_SaveHandler_Doctrine? =

Normally PHP sessions are stored as files in your linux or Windows file system. For a lot of projects this is fine. You can modify the session save_path to seperate the session files for proberly security reasons.

With bigger our complex projects where things as load balancing are neccasary saving the session is not that simple anymore. You could use memcache offcourse but a other approach is to save your sessions in the database. This is were Pike_Session_SaveHandler_Doctrine should take your intrest.

Are you like us using Zend Framework and Doctrine 2 integrated together? And do you want to store your sessions in the database without using the Zend_Session_SaveHandler_dbTable class which requires extra seperate configuration? Then take a look at this!
